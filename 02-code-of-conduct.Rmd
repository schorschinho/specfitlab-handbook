# Code of Conduct

**I have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination. Everything else in this lab handbook is negotiable. Violating our values and rules of good behavior, tolerance, inclusivity, and friendliness is not.**

All lab members (and their visitors) are expected to read and agree with the code of conduct to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

**The lab, and the university, is an environment that must be free of harassment and discrimination.**
All lab members are expected to read the [Johns Hopkins University policies on discrimination and harassment](https://oie.jhu.edu/policies-and-laws/jhu-policies/Johns_Hopkins_University_Discrimination_and_Harassment_Policy_and_Procedures), and comply with them at all times. 

The lab is committed to ensuring a safe, friendly, and accepting environment for everybody within and outside of our group, including collaborators, co-workers, staff, patients, and study participants. We will not under any circumstance tolerate any verbal or physical harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, culture, religious beliefs (or the lack thereof), or class. 

We will not under any circumstance tolerate intimidation, stalking, following, unwanted photography or video recording, unwanted messaging, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and other inappropriate interpersonal behavior. Finally, it should go without saying that lewd language and behavior have no place in the lab, including any lab outings or other social events.

## COVID policy

It is our responsibility to keep each other, our colleagues, our volunteers and patients safe under all circumstances. You are, of course, expected to comply with all official Hopkins regulations at any given time. It is further expected that you are considerate of the needs of the people you interact with, particularly of the elderly and immunocompromised. 

As of September 2022, please continue to consider  wearing a mask during close interactions (meetings, patient interviews, etc.) *as the default*. Even if there is no official mask mandate and you feel "it's fine" to take the mask off, the other person might not feel the same way.

## Reporting misconduct & feedback on behavior

It is expected that you report harmful behavior in violation of this code of conduct directly to me. If you notice someone being harassed or mistreated, or are harassed or mistreated yourself, please tell me immediately. If my own behavior is the cause of your concern, please immediately contact the division chair (currently Dr. Haris Sair), another faculty member who you trust, or the [Office of Postdoctoral Affairs](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/offices/pda/).

Your reporting and feedback will be kept strictly confidential, unless institutional policies require the disclosure towards the relevant offices, e.g. in cases of Title IX violations. 

There will never be minimizing of or repercussion for sounding the alarm about problematic behavior. However, if you fear negative consequences for reporting misconduct or negative feedback about a group member, you can do so anonymously (e.g. through a separate e-mail account) or through a third party.
