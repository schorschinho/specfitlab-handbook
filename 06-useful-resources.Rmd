# Useful resources

This is a living list of useful things to know when working in our lab at Johns Hopkins University.

## Software

Within the lab, we have a certain set of software that we preferably use for our work. Generally, you are free to use the software that best suits your workflow and training, although it is expected that you work in an environment that makes it easy for your work to be shared with (and collaborated on) others inside and outside our group.

### Operating Systems

Johns Hopkins offers free Windows and Office 365 downloads through myJH (https://my.jh.edu -> Technology -> mySoftware). Please see the licensure restrictions there for detailed information.

### MATLAB

Johns Hopkins offers campus MATLAB licenses that you can access by [creating a MathWorks account](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register) with your Hopkins e-mail address (jdoe1@jhmi.edu). You can download any MATLAB version from the MathWorks website, and will be asked to log into the MathWorks account during the installation. That should take care of all of the licenses. You should be able to install MATLAB and all MATLAB toolboxes on multiple devices this way.

### Image editing software

We frequently use Adobe Illustrator (and, to a much lesser degree, Photoshop) to apply final polishing to our figures, and to make traditional posters. Both are available as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud package. You will be [[Money#Technical equipment and software licenses | fully reimbursed for the annual license fee]].

If you prefer, you can, of course, also use free alternatives such as Inkscape and GIMP.

### Reference manager

It is *recommended* that you use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), an open-source, well-supported manager that can be modified with many useful plugins, for example enabling [cross-device sychronization with Google Drive or OneDrive ](https://tomsaunders.co.nz/zotero-with-google-drive/) using the [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/) plugin.

You can easily import your existing database from Mendeley, EndNote, RefWorks etc., by [exporting from those](https://libguides.unm.edu/Zotero/Import) in `.ris` format.
